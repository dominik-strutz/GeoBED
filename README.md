# GeoBED

This is a very experimental repository that implements a number of classic and new algorithms for Bayesian experimental design (BED) with a focus on geophysical applications.

A first attempt at a documentation can be found [here](https://geobed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you are interested in using any of the methods I am happy to help. See https://dominik-strutz.github.io for contact information.
